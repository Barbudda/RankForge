          <p>
            An audit report tells you what&apos;s wrong; your coding assistant can
            actually change the code. With Septune connected over MCP, one
            prompt (<em>&ldquo;audit my dev server and fix what you find&rdquo;</em>)
            runs the full technical-SEO audit against{" "}
            <span className="font-mono text-xs">localhost</span>, walks the
            findings, patches your files, and re-audits to verify. The
            measurements are deterministic (no AI guessing); the reasoning is
            your assistant&apos;s.

            The MCP server is the open-source CLI, started by your editor. It runs

            <span className="font-mono text-xs">localhost</span> and you see issues
            as you build, before deploying. It needs no account and no key, and it
            sends nothing anywhere: the only outside call is the optional Core Web
            Vitals lookup, which asks Google about the URL when you request it.

            Septune never writes to your repository: your assistant edits the
            files, and you review them as you would any change. The crawler
            identifies itself as SeptuneBot and honours robots.txt unless you
