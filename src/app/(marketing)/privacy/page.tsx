          <p>
            When you create an account: your email address and a password hash,
            both handled by Supabase Auth (we never see your plain password).
            When you connect a repository: its name, the production URL you
            provide, and the audits, issues and pull-request metadata RankForge
            generates for it.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            When you turn on monitoring: the alert email address and webhook URL
            you enter, and a record of each check: the score, what changed, and a
            snapshot of the public pages it read (status codes, titles,
            canonicals, the issues found). History is kept for{" "}
            {PLAN_LIMITS.free.historyMonths} months on Free,{" "}
            {PLAN_LIMITS.pro.historyMonths} on Pro and{" "}
            {PLAN_LIMITS.studio.historyMonths} on Studio; older checks are deleted
            automatically. Removing a site deletes its monitor and every check.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            When you subscribe to a paid plan: your Stripe customer id, the
            subscription&apos;s status, renewal and cancellation dates. Invoices
            are kept by Stripe, as accounting law requires.

            No advertising trackers, no analytics resale, no selling of your
            data. It goes only to the services listed below, and only for what
            they do to run RankForge. RankForge reads your site&apos;s rendered
            HTML and your repository structure; it never reads your environment
            secrets.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            The open-source CLI and the editor agent (MCP) run on your machine.
            They send nothing to RankForge.

        <ProseBlock heading="Who processes it">
          <ul className="mt-2 list-inside list-disc space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Supabase</strong> stores the data in a PostgreSQL project
              with row-level security, so each account can only ever read its own
              rows. It also handles sign-in.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vercel</strong> hosts the app and keeps the request logs any
              web host keeps.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resend</strong> delivers the monitoring emails: the alert
              address, the site name and what changed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stripe</strong> processes payments for Pro and Studio. It
              holds your card and billing details; RankForge only keeps your
              Stripe customer id, the subscription&apos;s status and its renewal
              date, and never sees your card.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Anthropic</strong>: audit runs may call its API to analyze
              crawled pages. Only the crawled page content and detected issues
              are sent, never your credentials.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Google</strong>: when Core Web Vitals are turned on, the
              monitored site&apos;s URL is sent to the Chrome UX Report API to
              read its public field data. Nothing else is sent.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3">
            Alerts you route to Slack, Discord or your own webhook are delivered
            to the URL you entered, and that service&apos;s own policy applies to
            them.
